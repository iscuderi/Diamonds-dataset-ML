# Diamonds-dataset-ML-Python

In this practice I have worked with the diamonds dataset which allowed me to apply different machine learning techniques.

Task performed:

- Predict the price of diamonds as a continuous variable.
- Predict the price of diamonds in 4 categories: cheap, normal, expensive, and very expensive.
- Predict the cut of diamonds.
